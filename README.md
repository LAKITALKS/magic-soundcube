# 🎧 Magic Soundcube

**Magic Soundcube** is an open-source AI-powered application that transforms auditory pattern recognition into an interactive learning experience.

---

### 🎯 What is it?

An innovative auditory puzzle platform where users reconstruct music, sounds, or sonic textures from fragmented pieces — like solving a Rubik's Cube with sound.

---

### 🔍 Use Cases

- Music education & ear training  
- Creative cognition games  
- Sound design exercises  
- AI-powered learning environments  
- Visual-auditory learning based on image prompts

---

### ⚙️ Powered by

- `GPT-4.1` & `o3` for reasoning, adaptive feedback, and level generation  
- `Codex CLI` for logic flow and interaction  
- `Whisper` for voice/audio transcription (optional)  
- `Librosa`, `Pydub`, and Python tools for audio processing

### 🌐 Vision

We believe in building tools that combine reasoning, creativity and sound to train perception and cognition.

Magic Soundcube supports learners, artists, and researchers in exploring the space between logic and intuition – through musical fragments, auditory puzzles, and **visually inspired listening tasks**.

In one of its future modes, users will be able to input **images or prompts** (e.g. "moonlit jungle ruins with distant thunder"), and the AI will generate a **matching soundscape**.  
This becomes the basis for a new kind of **visual-auditory reasoning**, where users train their ears by interpreting immersive, image-based sound environments.

This approach opens the door to a **multisensory learning experience** that blends imagination, listening, and cognitive development.
